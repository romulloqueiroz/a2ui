/**
 * Surface renderer driven by the node layer.
 *
 * `A2uiSurface` constructs one `NodeResolver` and renders the resolved
 * `ComponentNode` tree it maintains. Each implementation carries a generated
 * `view` (see `adapter.tsx`) that subscribes to its own node's props and
 * converts them back to the shapes existing views expect, so a data change
 * re-renders exactly the affected component. The surface only dispatches: it
 * hands each `view` its node and a `buildChild` that renders resolved child
 * nodes.
